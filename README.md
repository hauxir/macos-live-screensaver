# MacOS Live Screensaver

A macOS screensaver that plays live video streams. Supports YouTube videos and direct HLS streams.

> **Also available:** [Android TV Live Screensaver](https://github.com/hauxir/androidtv-live-screensaver)

## Why?

Turn any live stream into your screensaver/lockscreen. Some examples:

## Requirements

- macOS
- Swift compiler (Xcode Command Line Tools)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (optional, for YouTube support)

**Disclaimer**: This project was entirely vibe-coded. I've never written Swift before in my life.

**Note**: This was tested exclusively on macOS Tahoe on an M2 MacBook. Your mileage may vary on other versions/hardware.

## Installation

### Install yt-dlp (for YouTube support)

Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

Or using pip:
```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

### Build and Install

Build and install:
```bash
make install
```

Or step by step:
```bash
make build
open build/LiveScreensaver.saver
```

Other commands:
```bash
make clean      # Remove build directory
make uninstall  # Remove screensaver from ~/Library/Screen Savers/
make start      # Trigger screensaver immediately
```

## Usage

1. Open **System Preferences** â†’ **Screen Saver**
2. Select **Live Screensaver**
3. Click **Options** to configure
4. Enter a video URL:
   - YouTube: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID` **(live streams only)**
   - HLS stream: `https://example.com/stream.m3u8`

**Note**: Only live YouTube videos are supported. Regular (non-live) YouTube videos will not work.

**Note**: macOS screensaver UI can be buggy. If the Options button is unresponsive, try closing and reopening System Settings. PRs welcome for anyone who can figure out why.
## Troubleshooting

**YouTube videos don't play**:
- Make sure yt-dlp is installed and in your PATH
- Verify you're using a **live** YouTube stream - regular videos are not supported

**Black screen**: Wait a few seconds for loading, or try a different URL
